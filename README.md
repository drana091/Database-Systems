CSIT355 Database Systems - Final Project
Team Name: Dragons & Databases
Team Members: Jared Kruegel, Dhruv Rana, Xavier Warner, Stavros Kokkinos

# Goal 
To create and class(course) registration site, with an emphasis on the database handling and management.

# Overview
 Over the past few weeks, our team was tasked with creating a database using the skills
 we learned in class. The team, Database and Dragons, has four members and our goal was to use
 the game "Dungeons and Dragons'' as inspiration to develop a course registration site and
 respective database. We were hired by the local tabletop game store "The Dragons Dungeon''.
 For our project, we used Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition. We chose this edition because it
 was the newest addition and we realized that many participants in the store's annual DND parties
 were newcomers to the 5th edition. They only had a limited time to get hands-on experience
 while playing at the store. Our team's solution involves creating an online platform offering
 courses covering various aspects of D&D fifth edition. We provided these ideas to our client, and
 they agreed that our proposed idea was a good way to proceed
